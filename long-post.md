# Building Your First CLI Tool

Command-line tools are powerful. They're fast, scriptable, and perfect for automation. Here's how to build one.

## What You'll Need

Python 3.8 or newer and basic programming knowledge. We'll use the `typer` library to make a beautiful CLI interface.

## Step 1: Setup

Create a new directory and virtual environment. Install typer with pip. This gives you everything needed for a professional CLI.

## Step 2: Your First Command

Start simple. Create a command that takes a name and says hello. This teaches you the basics of argument parsing.

## Step 3: Adding Features

Add options, flags, and multiple commands. Make it colorful with rich. Add progress bars and nice formatting.

## Step 4: Testing

Test your tool with different inputs. Handle errors gracefully. Make sure help text is clear.

## What's Next

Package your tool so others can install it. Publish to PyPI. Add more features based on user feedback.
