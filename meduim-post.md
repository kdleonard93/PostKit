# Why Multi-Platform Publishing Matters

Your audience is fragmented across different platforms. Some people prefer Bluesky, others love Substack, and many use both.

## The Problem

Manually posting to each platform is tedious and time-consuming. You end up either:
- Skipping some platforms (losing audience)
- Spending hours copy-pasting (wasting time)
- Posting inconsistently (losing engagement)

## The Solution

Tools like postkit let you write once and publish everywhere automatically. This means more time creating, less time managing platforms.
