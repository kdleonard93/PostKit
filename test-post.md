# Testing postkit

This is my first post using postkit!

## Why This is Cool

I can write once and publish to multiple platforms:
- Bluesky
- Flashes
- Pinksky
- Substack

## How It Works

The tool automatically:
1. Reads this markdown file
2. Formats it for each platform
3. Publishes everything with one command
